# Bankist app

Bankist is a fictitious and minimalistic online banking application that allows the user to:

- Login
- Transfer a value to another account
- Request a loan from the bank
- Sort monetary movements
- Close (delete) account
 
In this application I worked with arrays, numbers, dates and timers (automatic log out). 
Also I formatted dates and regular numbers using the Internationalization API.


**Test accounts:**

1) user: js, pin:1111
2) user: jd, pin:2222
